Databases Course
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

The best way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to make sure that code is commented on and to use idustry standard coding practices. Having modularity in code can make diagnosis of issues or upgrades of code much easier. 

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist is first and formost about meeting the user's needs. The first step is to identify the user's needs and then create a program that allows those needs to be met.

Computer scientists how streamline the workflow of others and save them time and save companies money. We can also reduce the risk of human error with database work because a database will always sort through the whole thing, while a person could accidentally miss something.
